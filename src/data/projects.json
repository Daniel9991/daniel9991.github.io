      "This is the website for a small delivery-first bakery. Its main purpose is to show users the available products with their price, images and maybe a description. Another feature is letting users pick products and submitting their 'cart' to the bakery through a template Whatsapp message.",
      "The website was developed with Next.js App router. It leverages Server and Client components to combine server rendering with client side interactivity when required. A Zustand store (accesible by a context provider) handles some global state related to the products and the cart."
